"The fact is God could cause you to believe anything He wants you to.  But think about it for a minute.  Would you rather have someone love you because you made them love you, or because they wanted to love you.     The responsibility is on you to love God and take a step toward Him.  He promises to be there for you, but you have to look for yourself. Those who doubt this or dispute it have not givin it a sincere effort. Simple logic arguments are folly.

I have been using both IDE (or MFM) and SCSI drives for years.  I have 2 IDE and 1 SCSI on one system and the other with 2 IDE, 2 SCSI disk, and  1 SCSI CDROM.  I currently using ALWAYS IN2000 SCSI card, but I also have a Future Domain, a Western Digital SCSI card, and I work with an ADAPTIC  before.  As I recall, all these cards can support boot and floppy drive. However, to use with other controller (IDE, MFM...) the boot drive has to be the IDE (or MFM).  You CAN NOT boot from the SCSI if you have other  controller in the system.  If you guys only have 2 drives (1 IDE, 1 SCSI). just set up the IDE in your CMOS setup.  Make sure you can boot from it. Then, set up the SCSI controller (IRQ, DMA, etc). Set the SCSI drive to  ID 0.  Just plug and play for all the cards I seen so far.  Only if you  have more than 2 drives then you need driver for the third drive and so on.  If you have more question, email me, I will try to answer it. Good Luck!  William",comp_ibm

And yes, baseball includes the space between plays as well as the plays themselves.  I suspect that a lot of the complaining about long games, especially when it's coming from TV people, has to something to do with advertising. Probably time ""wasted"" in the middle of an inning, say by a batter stepping out of the box to fiddle with his gloves, or by a pitcher walking around behind the mound trying to collect his thoughts, could otherwise be sold as advertising time.

I don't really mind the length of games either.  If they want to speed the games up in sensible ways, that's fine with me too.

So there's a kind of nostagia for the old days, before expansion, the Soviet series, Gretzky and even Bobby Orr, when guys weren't afraid to take a hit, nobody floated and defensemen played defence. Who cares that that probably never really existed, the myth is still around in Canada and all the European in    fluence on the game has diminished it in some people's eyes.  Personally, I'd like to add before I get flamed, I love the fast-paced ""European"" game and think Don Cherry is a bit of an idiot. I have to say that I missed him when I was living in the States, though.

"----------------------------------------------------- It was a great atmosphere last night at the St. Louis Arena as Joseph and the Blues shutout the Hawks for the second consecutive game. People were cheering the Blues long before face-off time, and they kept going for the entire game. My friends and I went out celebrating until the early morning hours with some of the players. Here's a game summary from the St. Louis Post-Disptach. Enjoy...  By Dave Luecking Of The Post-Dispatch Staff:  At 10:24 p.m. Friday night, The Arena crowd of 17,965 paid homage to Blues goalie Curtis Joseph. The fans began bowing, their arms extended, taking the the lead from a fan who held a sign that read ``Only God Saves More Than Joseph.""  It was a fitting tribute to Joseph, who has brought the Blues to the verge of a surprising sweep.  Joseph recorded his second successive shutout Friday, blanking the Blackhawks 3-0 in Game 3 of the Norris Division semifinals and giving the Blues a 3-0 lead in the best-of-seven series.  The Blackhawks haven't scored against Joseph since the 8:51 mark of the second period of Game 1. Joseph has shut out the Blackhawks for 151 minutes 9 seconds, a Blues record. Jacques Plante held the previous record of 146:28, set in the first round of the 1969 playoffs against the Philadelphia Flyers, one of only two series the Blues have sweeped in their history.  The Blues can wrap up their first sweep since 1969 with a victory in Game 4, a nationally televised game that begins at noon Sunday. The Blues have had only two sweeps in franchise history, both in 1969, when they swept Philadelphia and Los Angeles en route to the Stanley Cup finals.  The shutout Friday was easier than on Wednesday in Game 2 when Joseph had to make 47 saves. This time, the Blues held the shots down to 34, and the Blackhawks couldn't touch Joseph.  Well, they touched Joseph, numerous times, shoving him and pushing him at  every opportunity to try to get him off his game. But Joseph and the Blues were unfazed, dishing out their own punishment along the way.  The Blues' grinders -- Bob Bassen, Rich Sutter, Kevin Miller and Dave Lowry -- wore down the Blackhawks, taking the visitors from Chicago off their game. The grinders set the stage for the glamour boys, the gifted playmakers and scorers, who made the most of their opportunities.  Craig Janney, Brett Hull and Nelson Emerson scored, getting one goal in each period. Hull assisted on Janney's first-period power play goal after two unwise Chicago penalties. Checker Miller set up Hull's goal in the second period, and rookie Denny Felsner assisted for Emerson, who scored at 16:44 of the final  period.  Blues fans jumped to their feet in celebration of that goal and began yelling ``Sweep. Sweep. Sweep."" They also taunted Chicago goalie Ed Belfour  ``Bell-Four. Bell-Four."" They also chanted ``Na, na-na-na, hey-hey good bye.""  Such talk is a tad premature. There's still one game left, but the Blues are on a roll. They have the Blackhawks on their heels.  The Blues set the tone early on Friday with two crunching hits in the first minute of play. Rich Sutter leveled Bryan Marchment, and Brendan Shanahan dumped Steve Smith at center ice.  Chicago tried to retaliate, but Troy Murray's decision to run into Joseph backfired. Referee Dan Marouelli gave him a roughing penalty.  The Blues didn't get a shot on goal on the power play, and they survived a scare after Chicago killed the penalty when Rick Zombo gave the puck away to Steve Larmer. Joseph stopped Larmer's shot and everything else Chicago threw at him in the first period. The 'Hawks ignored the scouting report on Joseph about shooting high and continued to shoot low, where Joseph's butterfly style is deadly.  Rookie Bret Hedican picked up three consecutive penalties midway through the period -- two for hooking and one for holding -- but Chicago got only two shots on goal, as many as Miller. The Blues' penalty killer twice stole the puck and just missed on good scoring chances against Belfour.   Marouelli began calling penalties on the Blackhawks to even things up. He caught Brent Sutter hooking Shanahan four seconds after Hedican's third penalty. He called Marchment for elbowing Janney along the boards at 14:58, and gave the Blues a two-man advantage 1:07 later when Christian Ruuttu slashed Shanahan.  The Blues worked around the puck on the ensuing power play, and Hull got it where he likes it -- in the high slot. Hull's shot hit Belfour's right shoulder, and the puck bounced precariously close to the goal line. Belfour dived back to cover, but the puck squirted loose to Janney, who poked it into the net at 16:53 for his first goal of the playoffs.  The Blues continued their relentless hitting as the period ended, and the Blackhawks lost their composure. Joe Murphy tripped Ron Wilson with two seconds remaining in the period, and after time had expired Smith upset the Blues by shooting the puck into the Blues' bench.  Chris Chelios made a move toward Joseph as the teams left the ice, and Marouelli slapped him with a 10-minute misconduct. Chicago survived the Blues' power play, but the loss of Chelios hurt. He didn't return until the midway point of the period, and within three minutes of his return, Hull had increased the Blues' lead to 2-0, deflecting in Miller's crisp pass.  Try as they might, the Blackhawks couldn't get to Joseph, who stopped everything they could throw at him. He stopped 12 shots in the second period and 13 more in the third. Chicago also hit the goalpost twice.  Emerson's goal put the game away. He went hard to the net and redirected Felsner's pass.    %*%*%*%**%*%%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*   *   __  ______________         ____________________________________    %    %   \ \_)____________/         A L L E Z   L E S   B L U E S  ! ! !    *    *    \    __________/          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    %    %     \    ________/                                                   *   *      \   _______/                  Joe Ashkar                        %    %       \  \                         Contact for the Blues             *   *        \  \  SAINT LOUIS           jca2@cec1.wustl.edu               %    %        (___)             BLUES                                       *    *%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*% ",roc_sport_hockey

I'd be willing to bet that _every_ manufacturer used those little self-contained modules.  I think Sharp made them. Radio Shack used to sell them for a few bucks (maybe they still do.)  The module had 3 leads:  power, ground and demodulated output.  It contained the photo-detector, amplifier, integrator and demodulator all in a tiny metal can.

The solution (for the car) is to clean the plug leads and spray with WD-40 (moisture repellant).  If damp *is* the problem, then storing the  battery off the ground may help.

I don't know the first thing about yeast infections but I am a scientist. No scientist would take your statement --- ""no convincing empirical evidence to support the existence of systemic yeast syndrome"" --- to tell you anything except an absence of data on the question.  Noring has pointed out the catch-22 that if the ""crazy"" theory were true, you probably couldn't find any direct evidence of it --- that you couldn't observe those yeastie beasties with present methods even if they were there.  Noring and the fellow from Oklahoma (sorry, forgot your name) have also suggested one set of anecdotal evidence in favor based on their personal experiences --- namely, that when people with certain conditions are given anti-fungals, many of them appear to get better.    So, if you have any evidence *against* the hypothesis --- for example, controlled double-blind studies showing that the anti-fungals don't do any better than sugar water --- then let's hear it.  If you don't, then what we have is anecdotal and uncontrolled evidence on one side, and abject disbelief on the other.  In which case, please, there is no point in yelling back and forth at each other any longer since neither side has any convincing evidence either positive or negative.    And I understand that your abject disbelief is based on the existence of people who may get famous or make money applying the diagnosis to everything in sight, making wild claims with no evidence, and always refusing to do controlled studies.  But that has absolutely no bearing on the apparently sincere experiences of the people on the net observing anti-fungals working on themselves and other people in certain specific cases.  There are also quacks who sell oral superoxide dismutase, in spite of the fact that it's completely broken down in the guts, but this doesn't change the genuine scientific knowledge about the role of superoxide dismutase in fighting oxidative damage.  Same thing.  Just cause there are candida quacks, that doesn't establish evidence against the candida hypothesis.  If there's some other reason (besides the quacks), if only anecdotal, to think it could be true, then that is what has to be considered, that is what the net people have been talking about.  But again, there is no point in arguing about it.  There is anecdotal evidence, and there is no convincing evidence, and there are also some candida quacks out there, I hope everyone can agree on all of that.  Thus, it appears to me the main question now is whether the proponents can marshall enough anecdotal evidence in a convincing and documented enough manner to make a good case for carrying out a good controlled double-blind study of antifungals (or else, forget convincing anybody else to carry out the test, just carry it out themselves!) --- and also, whether they can adequately define the patient population or symptoms on which such a study should be carried out to provide a fair test of the hypothesis.

To quote Unger's Bible Dictionary on the Apocrapha: 1. They abound in historical and geographical inaccuracies and anachronisms. 2. They teach doctrines which are false and foster practices which are at variance with sacred Scripture. 3. They resort to literary types and display an artificiality of subject matter and styling out of keeping with sacred Scripture. 4.

But the problem with this argument lies in the assumption that the Hebrew canon included the Apocrapha in the first place, and it wasn't until the sixteenth century that Luther and co. threw them out. The Jewish council you mentioned previously didn't accept them, so the reformation protestants had good historical precedence for their actions. Jerome only translated the apocrapha under protest, and it was literally 'over his dead body' that it was included in the catholic canon.  >The simple fact is that Protestant exclusion, Roman inclusion, Orthodox >inclusion of still other books, or any other definition of a closed canon >is the decision of a community of faith about what the standard collection >of scripture shall be for that community.

It is also noteworthy to consider Jesus' attitude. He had no argument with the pharisees over any of the OT canon (John 10.31-6), and explained to his followers on the road to Emmaus  that in the law, prophets and psalms which referred to him - the  OT division of Scripture (Luke 24.44), as well as in Luke 11.51 taking Genesis to Chronicles (the jewish order - we would say Genesis to Malachi) as Scripture.  >See Dr. Lee MacDonald's _The Formation of the Christian Biblical Canon_ >(Abingdon, 1988) for a clear and faithful examination of the origins and >issues of the canon.

I don't think Joe was saying any such thing.  However, your question on ""asking Jesus to come into your heart"" seems to imply that infants are not allowed to have Christ in theirs.  Why must Baptism always be viewed by some people as a sort of ""prodigal son"" type of thing; i.e. a sudden change of heart, going from not accepting Christ to suddenly accepting Christ?  Why can't people start out with Christ from shortly after birth, and build their relationship from there?  After all, does a man suddenly meet a woman, and then marry her that same day?  From my experiences, I've learned that all relationships must be built, including one's relationship with God.     Also Joe is speaking from the standpoint that Baptism is not just a ritual, but that through it God bestows sacramental grace upon the recipient.  Certainly for those with the mental faculties to know Christ it is necessary to believe in Him.  However, the Sacrament itself bestows grace on the recipient, and makes a permanent mark of adoption into God's family on the soul.  -	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	- Steve Creps, Indiana University creps@lateran.ucs.indiana.edu",soc_religion_christian

As to why these early practices ""only parallel"" and do not exactly duplicate the modern LDS ceremony, there are a couple of reasons:  1.  Quite likely we do not have the exact original from ancient times.  This stuff was not commonly known but bits and pieces undoubtedly spread.

In the tape, it is interesting to see the way the Weatherpersons dance around the issue of one of their defining moments, which was when a few of their comrades managed to blow themselves up manufacturing bombs in a Greenwich village townhouse. The problem, one of them said, was that they were so caught up in their armed struggle that they *forgot* about their own personal safety and weren't ""careful.""

Aside from the tears, feeling sick to my stomach, etc., the really horrible psychological effect was that of suddenly falling to pieces and not knowing why it had happened---I was horrified and wondered what disease or other health problem I had.  (I didn't find out about the march and the tear-gas till hours later.)  I can imagine how horribly disorienting this might be to very young children: suddenly crying uncontrollably and feeling sick, weak, and out of control of your body---and not knowing the cause.  ``This gives us a chance to try the Gas of Peace.''

I find it very interesting that you say there will be 2.5 million queers in the march on Washington.  The largest figure I've seen in the press is 1 million and we all know how liberal the press is with their numbers. :)  For another thing, 1% of 250 million is 2.5 million not 6.  Maybe that's where you got the 2.5 million number.  Also, the number cited in the actual report is 1.5% so that would be about 3.75 million.  As for this march on Washington, I wonder how much the media is going to inflate the numbers this time.

He had been accused of a number of differing crimes (inconsistantly) over the last two months, but  this is the first time I have heard that one. I had heard child abuse but this is somewhat stronger. It is fairly obvious that Koresh  was hiding behind the children; and ironicly considering his apocalyptic dread, believed enough in the American People's inherent goodness to believe he was protected. It is truly amazing that all these people who 60 days ago had never heard of  the Branch Davidian now believe that he was suicidal, crazy, a child abuser and  a immenant danger to others based solely on what the Government spokespersons had said. Remember that these people have an awful lot to loose if it is found that they have screwed up.  But they don't have as much to lose as David Koresh and his followers lost. For in our society as it stands murder is not one of the heinous crimes.   --------------------------------------------------------------------- cutter@gloster.via.mind.org (chris)     All jobs are easy                                       to the person who                                      doesn't have to do them.

For your part, when you say that relativism is true, that's just your opinion.  Why do folk get so heated then, if a belief in relativism is merely a matter of taste?

Are all christians a flock of sheep, >unable to do otherwise that follow the rest?     i don't consider myself an unthinking sheep.  the bible says god created us to be in communion and obedience to him.  the first and only rule was to not eat of a certain tree, or else the punishment is distance from him and physical death.  god's intention in creating us is to have a relationship with us.  the bible documents god's attempts to have that relationship culminating in the person of jesus to bear the consequences of all sin so that all who accept him can have a relationship with god again: the purpose of creation.    who is god to impose rules on us?  he's god and he created us.  i suppose he has a right based on who he is.  above you mention ""In his infinite wisdom"", and that's what i'd say god exemplifies.  but if you were being sarcastic up there, then this whole discussion is irrelevant, eh?  and if we believe god is infinitely wise, that belief should inform our relationship with him.",religion_misc
